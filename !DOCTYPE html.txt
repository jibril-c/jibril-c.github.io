                <h2>Seeking Refuge in Allah</h2>
                <p>
                    These Surahs teach us to seek refuge in Allah from all kinds of evil. It's like having a superhero protector! When we feel scared or worried, we can ask Allah to keep us safe.

                <h2>The Oneness of Allah</h2>
                <p>
                    Surah Al-Ikhlas reminds us that Allah is one and unique. There's no one like Him! This helps us focus our worship on Allah alone.

                <h2>Protection from Hidden Evils</h2>
                <p>
                    Surah Al-Falaq teaches us to seek protection from hidden evils, like the darkness of night or the whispers of jealousy. It's like having a shield against things we can't always see.
